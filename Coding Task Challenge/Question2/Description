Write a program that finds the most optimized set of 6 units to shop with for values
fewer than 100. Example: Units used are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 1: 1 (1 unit used) 2: 2 (1
unit used) 3: 1+2 (2 units used) 4: 2+2 (2 units used) ... 98: 1+2+5+20+20+50 (6 units
used) 99: 2+2+5+20+20+50 (6 units used) AVG of units = 3.4
